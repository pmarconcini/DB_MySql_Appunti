13.2.3 DO Statement
DO expr [, expr] ...
DO executes the expressions but does not return any results. In most respects, DO is shorthand for SELECT expr, ..., but has the advantage that it is slightly faster when you do not care about the result.

DO is useful primarily with functions that have side effects, such as RELEASE_LOCK().

Example: This SELECT statement pauses, but also produces a result set:

mysql> SELECT SLEEP(5);
+----------+
| SLEEP(5) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (5.02 sec)
DO, on the other hand, pauses without producing a result set.:

mysql> DO SLEEP(5);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (4.99 sec)
This could be useful, for example in a stored function or trigger, which prohibit statements that produce result sets.

DO only executes expressions. It cannot be used in all cases where SELECT can be used. For example, DO id FROM t1 is invalid because it references a table.

13.2.4 EXCEPT Clause
query_expression_body EXCEPT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body
    [EXCEPT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body]
    [...]

query_expression_body:
    See Section 13.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”
EXCEPT limits the result from the first query block to those rows which are (also) not found in the second. As with UNION and INTERSECT, either query block can make use of any of SELECT, TABLE, or VALUES. An example using the tables a, b, and c defined in Section 13.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”, is shown here:

mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE b;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE b EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
As with UNION and INTERSECT, if neither DISTINCT nor ALL is specified, the default is DISTINCT.

DISTINCT removes duplicates found on either side of the relation, as shown here:

mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT DISTINCT TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT ALL TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
(The first statement has the same effect as TABLE c EXCEPT TABLE a.)

Unlike UNION or INTERSECT, EXCEPT is not commutative—that is, the result depends on the order of the operands, as shown here:

mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
As with UNION, the result sets to be compared must have the same number of columns. Result set column types are also determined as for UNION.

EXCEPT was added in MySQL 8.0.31.

13.2.8 INTERSECT Clause
query_expression_body INTERSECT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body
    [INTERSECT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body]
    [...]

query_expression_body:
    See Section 13.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”
INTERSECT limits the result from multiple query blocks to those rows which are common to all. Example:

mysql> TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    3 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE b;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    1 |    3 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
|    1 |    3 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE a INTERSECT TABLE b;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE a INTERSECT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
As with UNION and EXCEPT, if neither DISTINCT nor ALL is specified, the default is DISTINCT.

DISTINCT can remove duplicates from either side of the intersection, as shown here:

mysql> TABLE c INTERSECT DISTINCT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c INTERSECT ALL TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
|    1 |    3 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
(TABLE c INTERSECT TABLE c is the equivalent of the first of the two statements just shown.)

As with UNION, the operands must have the same number of columns. Result set column types are also determined as for UNION.

INTERSECT has greater precedence than and is evaluated before UNION and EXCEPT, so that the two statements shown here are equivalent:

TABLE r EXCEPT TABLE s INTERSECT TABLE t;

TABLE r EXCEPT (TABLE s INTERSECT TABLE t);
For INTERSECT ALL, the maximum supported number of duplicates of any unique row in the left hand table is 4294967295.

INTERSECT was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
